# DexBridge - Decentralized Exchange with Cross-Chain Bridge

A modern, **100% self-contained** decentralized exchange (DEX) built with React, TypeScript, and custom smart contracts. DexBridge provides seamless token swapping, liquidity provision, cross-chain bridging, and comprehensive analytics with **NO external dependencies** on protocols like Uniswap, LayerZero, or Axelar.

## üåü Features

### Core DEX Functionality
- **Custom DEX Contracts**: Our own Factory.sol, Router.sol, and Pair.sol (Uniswap V2-style)
- **Token Swapping**: Swap tokens using our proprietary routing system
- **Liquidity Pools**: Create and manage liquidity pools within our ecosystem
- **Multi-Chain Deployment**: Deploy on Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Arbitrum
- **Real-time Pricing**: AMM-based pricing with slippage protection
- **LP Token Management**: Mint and burn LP tokens for liquidity providers

### Cross-Chain Bridge
- **Custom Bridge Contracts**: Lock/Mint and Burn/Release mechanisms
- **Native Bridge Logic**: No LayerZero, no Axelar - 100% owned infrastructure
- **Admin-Controlled**: Relayer system for cross-chain transaction processing
- **Token Locking**: Lock tokens on source chain, mint on destination
- **Burn & Release**: Burn wrapped tokens, release native tokens
- **Bridge Dashboard**: Real-time transaction tracking and history

### Advanced Features
- **Admin Panel**: Manage supported tokens, relayers, and bridge settings
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track TVL, volume, and trading metrics
- **Rewards System**: Staking and farming with our DXB token
- **Professional UI**: Dark/light mode with responsive design
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask and Web3 wallet support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

- **MetaMask** or compatible Web3 wallet
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dex-bridge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy smart contracts** (for local development)
   ```bash

### Environment Setup (Optional)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory for custom configuration:

```env
# Smart Contract Deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# RPC URLs for deployment
VITE_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### DEX Contracts

#### Factory.sol
- Creates new trading pairs
- Manages pair registry
- Emits PairCreated events

#### Router.sol  
- Handles all user interactions
- Manages liquidity operations
- Executes token swaps
- Calculates optimal routing paths

#### Pair.sol
- Individual trading pair contract
- Implements AMM (x * y = k) formula
- Manages LP token minting/burning
- Handles swap execution

### Bridge Contracts

#### BridgeCore.sol
- Main bridge contract for each chain
- Handles token locking and releasing
- Manages supported tokens and fees
- Controls relayer permissions

#### DexBridgeWrappedToken.sol
- Wrapped token contract for non-native assets
- Mintable/burnable by bridge contract
- Standard ERC-20 implementation

### Token Contracts

#### DexBridgeToken.sol (DXB)
- Native governance and utility token
- Used for staking and rewards
- Deflationary tokenomics

#### WETH.sol
- Wrapped ETH implementation
- Standard deposit/withdraw functions
