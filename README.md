## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Hardhat Deployment Issues

If you encounter issues with Hardhat deployment:

1. **Check Network Configuration**
   - Verify RPC URLs in `hardhat.config.js`
   - Ensure private key is correctly set
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Gas Issues**
   - Adjust gas settings in `hardhat.config.js`
   - Ensure wallet has sufficient funds

3. **Contract Size Limits**
   - If contracts exceed size limits, try enabling optimization
   - Split large contracts if necessary

4. **Use Remix IDE Alternative**
   - Follow the "Alternative: Deploying with Remix IDE" section above
   - This provides a more visual, step-by-step approach

### Frontend Connection Issues

If the frontend can't connect to contracts:

1. **Check Contract Addresses**
   - Verify addresses in `src/constants/contracts.ts`
   - Ensure they match deployed contracts

2. **Network Mismatch**
   - Make sure wallet is connected to the correct network
   - Check chainId matches in configuration

3. **ABI Issues**
   - Verify ABIs match deployed contract versions
   - Regenerate ABIs if necessary

### Mobile-Specific Issues

For mobile-specific problems:

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Use WalletConnect for better mobile compatibility
   - Ensure deep linking is properly configured

2. **UI Rendering**
   - Test on multiple device sizes
   - Use browser developer tools to simulate different devices

3. **Performance**
